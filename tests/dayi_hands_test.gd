## The opposite dayı handles real tiles: moves one along his rack, drops one on the felt, picks it back up.
## Checks that his pinch closes right on each tile, that the tile ends where it should and stays in his hand while
## carried (except while his fingers lay it flat). Exits with code 1 on any failure.
